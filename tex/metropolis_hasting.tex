		\item[] $$\rho: \mathfrak{G} \mapsto \mathbb{R}_{+}.$$  
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textcolor{green}{As.}] $Q_k (x,S)$ is known for all $k$,
	\item[\textcolor{green}{As.}] $\forall_{x \in \Gamma} \underset{ k \in \mathcal{K}}{\sum} Q_k (x,S) \leq 1$,
	\item[\textcolor{green}{As.}] For all $k \in \mathcal{K}$ $$R_k (x,y_k) \equiv \frac{\rho(\mathrm{d } y_k)Q_k (y_k, \mathrm{d }x)}{\rho(\mathrm{d } x)Q_k (x, \mathrm{d }y_k)}$$ is known ans possible to evaluate for any $x$ and $y_k$ 
	\item[\textcolor{green}{As.}] For each $x$ and $k$ one can draw from 
		$$P_k(x, \circ) \equiv \frac{Q_k (x, \circ)}{Q_k (x, \Gamma)}$$

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Simulate random index $K$ with probability $\mathbb{P}( K = k ) = Q_k (x,\Gamma)$.
		\item[] With probability $1-\underset{k \in \mathcal{K}}{\sum} Q_k (x,\Gamma)$ skip the remaining steps and stay at $x$.
		\item Simulate $Y \sim P_K (x, \circ)$.
		\item Calculate $R_K (x,Y)$.
		\item Accept $Y$ with probability $1\wedge R_K (x,Y)$.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item[] $$P(x,A) \equiv$$
		\item[]	$$ \underset{k \in \mathcal{K}}{\sum} \int_A \alpha_k (x,y_k) Q_k(x, \mathrm{d }y_k) + \delta_x (A) \Big(1 - \underset{k \in \mathcal{K}}{\sum} \int_{\Omega} \alpha(x,y_k) Q_k(x,\mathrm{d }y_k) \Big) $$
	
		\item[] where $\alpha(x,y_k) \equiv 1\wedge R_K (x,y_k)$

		\item[] Note: kernel is stochastic. 
		\item[] According to the general theory MHG update is reversible with respect to $\rho$
