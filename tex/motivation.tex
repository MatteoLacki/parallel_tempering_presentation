		\item Stochastic simulation algorithm
		\item a.k.a. replica exchange Monte Carlo 
		\begin{itemize}	
			\item sampling method  
		\end{itemize}
		\item Extension to Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \dots
		\item \dots or rather Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item more abstract version: general kernels
			\item more freedom: discrete kernels, continous kernels, different dimensions

		\frametitle{Why Parallel Tempering? }
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Tool to fight \emph{ multimodality }
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "allows good mixing with multimodial target distributions"
			\item response to Metropolis-Hastings localness    
			\item better estimation of integrals $ \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(x) \pi(x) \mathrm{d} x $
		\end{itemize}
		\item[] 

		\item In certain physical models: thermodynamic interpretation
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Gibbs random-field model
